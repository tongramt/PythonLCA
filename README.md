# PythonLCA
# This repository contains the Python implementation of the Lowest Common Ancestor for Software Engineering CSU33012-A
This repository now contains the LCA implementation and testing for Software Engineering.
Some things to be aware of when reviewing my code:
1) due to a mistake about what the criteria for LCA Assignment I the assignment was uploaded late. This was approved by prof. Barrett
2) during the attempted merging of my branches DAG and Main I overwrote the files for LCA I. I had to add these files in under new names as I had made the mistake of using the original files to add implementation and testing for LCA II.
